# Artificial Vision Projects

## Overview
This project has the purpose of concentrate all my practices of Artificial Vision and to be a guide of how to learn to made projects that include the image manipulation and shapes recognition.

This practices are based in 2 main languages: Matlab and Python. Matlab is the main language in my course but I'm interesting in recreate the same processes using python.

There is some content created with Labview and some stuff made with javascript but who cares.
